- figure out better when free2work intends to rate entire companies rather
  than just brands within them (this is probably true for everything except
  coffee)
- special-case scope restriction (apparel and electronics) on Woolworths
  Limited rather than just treating it as a correction
  - for bonus points, note that AWA and Abode are electronics brands anyway
- special-case Amazon Kindle (which is listed as a "company", but is
  actually a brand of Amazon.com)
